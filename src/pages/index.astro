		<TextBlock title="Project goals" id="goals">
			<p>Before you design anything, it's important to take a step back and think about the project's complexity. </p>
			<p>What are your goals? Who are you talking to? And, how do you want the audience to feel when they look at your design?</p>
			<p>It's helpful to write down these insights and use them as a reference to evaluate your design along the way.</p>
		</TextBlock>
	
		<TextBlock title="Content design" id="content">
			<p>After defining the key objectives of your project, it's time to gather all assets like text, images, or graphics. </p>
			<p>Do you have everything you need? Do you need to search for additional assets, or can you create them yourself?</p>
			<p>Next, prepare your text by structuring, condensing, and rewriting it to include only the most essential parts needed to convey your key message.</p>
		</TextBlock>
	
		<TextBlock title="Layout sketches" id="sketches">
			<p>Once text and images are defined, you can explore different ways to arrange them by sketching on a piece of paper. </p>
			<p>It's beneficial to use just basic shapes and focus on the rough arrangement of elements. This helps you decide on one layout that you can then refine in detail.</p>

		<TextBlock title="Accessibility" id = "accessibility">
			<p>There are people out there with different kind of abilities and we want to make sure that we reduce friction for them to consume our content.</p>
		</TextBlock>

		<TextBlock title="Simplicity" id = "simplicity">
			<p>In order to do so we make our content and our design as simple as possible and show what is needed, when it is needed. This helps everyone to consume our content with ease.</p>
		</TextBlock>

		<TextBlock title="Iteration" id = "iteration">
			<p>Almost nothing is done right the first time and this is especially true for design. Always start with a first idea and then make variations of it and see if you have improved on that.</p>
			<p>Most of the time you should ask yourself what you can add or remove to communicate your message better.</p>
