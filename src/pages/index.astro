	<Section chapter="Chapter 1" title="Preparation">
		<TextBlock title="Start with the goals" id="goals">
			<p>Before you design anything it is important to take a step back and think about what you want to achieve with the designed thing.</p>
			<p>It is helpful to write down your goals and have them as a reference to evaluate your design along the way.</p>
		</TextBlock>
	
		<TextBlock title="Know your audience" id="audience">
			<p>While you think about your goals you should also define the intended target audience your are talking to.</p>
			<p>This will affect the words you should use for writing and the look and feel of the design.</p>
		</TextBlock>
	
		<TextBlock title="Prepare your design" id="preparation">
			<p>Most of your design will be written words and images or graphics to support them. It helps a lot to create a rough outline of the thing you want to design to define what elements you need and where you might place them.</p>
			<p>This can be done on a piece of paper, since it is quick and letâ€™s you explore different options quickly.</p>
		</TextBlock>
	
		<TextBlock title="Words are important" id="writing">
			<p>We use design techniques to ensure the message we want to communicate is best received by the audience.</p>
			<p>Since most of the design is written word we should have it as final as possible when we start designing, so that we can support the content with how we design it.</p>
		</TextBlock>
	</Section>

	<Section chapter="Chapter 2" title="Principles">
		<TextBlock title="Accessibility" id = "accessibility">
			<p>There are people out there with different kind of abilities and we want to make sure that we reduce friction for them to consume our content.</p>
		</TextBlock>

		<TextBlock title="Simplicity" id = "simplicity">
			<p>In order to do so we make our content and our design as simple as possible and show what is needed, when it is needed. This helps everyone to consume our content with ease.</p>
		</TextBlock>

		<TextBlock title="Iteration" id = "iteration">
			<p>Almost nothing is done right the first time and this is especially true for design. Always start with a first idea and then make variations of it and see if you have improved on that.</p>
			<p>Most of the time you should ask yourself what you can add or remove to communicate your message better.</p>
		</TextBlock>
